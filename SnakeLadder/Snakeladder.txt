UC1
Snake and Ladder game played with single player at start position 0

so in this use case we have to define player position 0
n just we have to print player position

UC2
The Player rolls the die to get a number between 1 to 6. - Use ((RANDOM)) to get the number between 1 to 6

In this use case roll die to get number.
and use Random class to generate random number
Random rand = new Random();     //Random is class.We have to create object of random class
int diceRoll = rand.Next(1, 7);		//so using Next Method we can generate random number so 1,7 means it will generate number betweem 1 to 6
